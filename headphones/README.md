# Headphones Landing Page

## Description  
This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Web Development** program.  
It involves recreating a landing page from a Figma design using only **HTML and CSS**, with emphasis on **accessibility**, **responsiveness**, and **clean code structure**.

The objective is to implement the design **pixel-perfectly**, so that the web page matches the Figma mockups on both desktop and mobile.

## Figma File  
The design was created by **Nicolas Philippot (UI/UX Designer)**.  
You can view and duplicate the design here:

If the Figma link is inaccessible, use the backup Figma file provided in your project resources.
